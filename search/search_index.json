Project description Lending money to other people can be a very lucrative business. However, this is just the case if you maximize the number of people that pay back the loan and minimize the number of loans that are defaulting. The credit risk assessment is used to ensure that money is only lent to people for whom the probability of default is as low as possible or in an acceptable range.

In the exploratory data analysis I analyzed the data, searched for patterns and prepared the data for training. Outliers The data had some outliers in various features like person employment lenght which contained a max of 123 years person income which contained a max of 6.000.000 $ with a median of 55.000 $ person age which contained a max of 144 years After some further exploration of these outliers I deleted the rows containing these values. NaN Values The data had two features that contained some NaN values. There were 895 rows with NaN values in the column person employment length. I imputed these missing values with the median value for all employment length. There were 3116 rows with NaN values in the column loan interest rate. I deleted the rows with missing values in this column. Distribution In credit risk assessment it is common to deal with data that is highly imbalanced regarding the target class. This is because usually there are more people that pay back their loan than people that do not pay back their loan. In the used dataset there are about 3.58 times more non defaults than defaults. In the final model training I am therefore using different methods to optimize for imbalanced data.","title":"Exploratoy data analysis"},{"location":"eda/#welcome-to-my-capstone-project-credit-risk-assessment","text":"","title":"Welcome to my capstone project \"Credit Risk Assessment\""},{"location":"eda/#exploratory-data-analysis","text":"The data that I used for this project is loan data of around 32000 borrowers that contains 12 columns including the target variable \u201cloan status\u201d.
