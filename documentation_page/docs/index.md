# Welcome to my capstone project "Credit Risk Assessment"

## Project description

Lending money to other people can be a very lucrative business. However, this is just the case if you maximize the number of people that pay back the loan and minimize the number of loans that are defaulting. The credit risk assessment is used to ensure that money is only lent to people for whom the probability of default is as low as possible or in an acceptable range.
